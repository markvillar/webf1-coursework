		<h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>
      HTML5 is a markup language used to structure most of the pages that are currently on the web, it is used to describe the content (model) of what is presented on a page. Some semantic tags in HTML are header, body, footer, section, article, aside, video etc. If HTML however does not have appropriate tag for what you as the developer needs, some non-conventional tags, although these tags are strongly discouraged if possible, such as divs and span.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Addressing (External and Relative Links)</h2>
    <p>
External link contains the full URL of the website between the two double quotes and its label in between a tag,
while relative link contains only the sub-folder and/or the full name of the file it is being linked to, for example the main domain is example.com
    </p>

    <h2>CSS Stylesheet</h2>
    <p>
      Stylesheet is a file containing instructions on how bits of markup should be presented in a page on the browser.

      <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
      <p>
        Different types of selectors:
        <ul>ID selector</ul>
        <ul>Class selector</ul>
        <ul>Child selector</ul>

        Selectors are used to pick html elements in order to add style to the said element. CSS can be used to add borders, background colours, shadows, resize font sizes, positioning, etc. CSS is useful in that it keeps you as the developer from styling repetitively, a style can be written once but can be repeated as many times as you (as a developer) need to.
        The only caveat of CSS however is that, unlike other scripting/programming languages, it is not able to intelligently or automatically redefine or reuse stylesheets that have already been defined within the stylesheet, for example, a developer cannot assign a colour to a variable and use the variable throughout the CSS, the developer would have to write multiple CSS properties for different viewports or screen sizes.
      </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Content & Form Separation</h2>
    <p>
      <p>HTML (Markup) - Anything added to text or information that helps convey its meaning i.e. pictures, diagrams etc.</p>
      <p>CSS (Stylesheet) - A document that tells the browser how bits of markup should be presented.
      An ideal approach to structuring HTML page is what is called descriptive structure which means only the contents of the page should be added on the page document and not what it is going to look like or formatted on the page.
      The other approach (not recommended) is what is known as procedural approach, which is very similar to descriptive except it involves using tags such as br and center which are now almost obsolete and deprecated. </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Design Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Model View Controller (MVC) is a commonly used design pattern in programming and web development realm, it is also the paradigm that HTML and CSS also follows. This paradigm strictly follows the content and form separation, this means the developer can focus on designing the view or the very interface of the website without the possibility of accidentally deleting or removing parts of the website that could affect both the model (contents) and controller (how HTML and CSS interacts).
    </p>

    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <p>
      It is important to have good quality UI design, as UI or user interface is what interacts with your intended users who may not be technically literate or does not know exactly what is happening behind the scenes, it is then  even more important to have simple, clear and concise design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without proper or high quality GUI, a good website/program with a lot of functionalities could be rendered useless if it is proven to be difficult to use, while a website or a program with some very basic functionalities but with a good and high quality UI is more likely to attract more users than the previous example given. A good or bad user interface heavily affects the perception of your intended users.
    </p>
    <p>
      As designer or developer, It is also important to get some feedback from intended users as to what their opinion on your current design, what can be improved, what can be added, and how to make it really useful overall as developers designing the website/software often do not see these different perception.
