    <h1>User Online Privacy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This literature review focuses on how online entities collecting information from customers, how they use and protect this information, right to privacy and the risks and prevention of widespread privacy leakage as result of unintentional distribution
        of information and how information can be easily obtained from somebody who uses (OSNs) Online Social Networks based on his/her interests through social engineering.</p>

    <h2>Third-party disclosure of Personal information</h2>
    <p>This part of the work focuses on how companies collect information through the services that they offer. Third-party companies that works with companies that offers software as service which often collects identifiable information from their users
        to be used to the companies’ advantage by selling users’ information to third-parties for targeted advertisements and behavioural analysis in order to find out more information about their customers, according to (Myers, 2016) "Third-party
        tracking methods, such as cookies, allow companies with whom the user is not interacting to similarly monitor online activity and tailor advertisements." This arguably is a breach of privacy especially if users are unaware and did not give
        explicit permission for companies to disclose collected information they provided in such manner.</p>

    <p>While it is true that companies do state their terms and conditions on to their users who use their services, but they are often presented in a document which Myers described as "often written in lengthy, complex legalese" (Myers, 2016) which
        many users according to (Myers, 2016) "view the acceptance of terms and conditions as an obstacle to their online activity, not explicit consent to compile and sell their personal information."</p>

    <h2>Risks and prevention of privacy abuse</h2>
    <p>Although data collection also brings some beneficial outcomes for customers to some extent i.e. personalisation, this also gives them the leverage to abuse this collected information, for example, grocery stores are now more than capable to keep
        track of details about their customers’ purchases which "Insurance companies can purchase this information on a potential insured to determine a person's dietary habits whether the person purchases red meat, cigarettes, or alcohol to determine
        if the insured may be a greater risk to the company." (Petersen, 1995) pertaining to the information collected through the grocery store for other means which can also simply be an online buy and sell service on the web.</p>

    <p>To prevent such harmful exploitation, it is important that personal information given is be kept to a minimum unless necessary and for users to be aware of the type of information they are giving away and as to which online entity they are trusting
        their information to, and whether the company has a good privacy policy in place. (Myers, 2016) also goes on to say that "Although the contract law principle that failure to read an agreement is no excuse."  Therefore, companies often get
        away with what supposed to be the consequences of the unethical use of information because users are often compelled to accept or agree to these policies to proceed and use their services.</p>

    <h2>Information gathering through Social Engineering</h2>
    <p>A recent study conducted at National Chung Cheng University on OSNs (Online Social Network) showed that information can also easily be leaked by people relative to that person unknowingly when it comes to sharing information online. But this “increases
        the chances of successful targeted attacks or spear phishing by social engineering.” Lin, P.-C., & Lin, P.-Y. (2016, July 1). Social engineering is one of many techniques that can be used to retrieve information from a victim without them
        knowing about it. Right to Privacy (Petersen, 1995) have said that our privacy on the web is almost “virtually obsolete” hence titled “Your Life as An Open Book.” She argues that the main reason why privacy abuse is still prevalent and an
        increasing problem to this day is that because according to our (Petersen, 1995) “failure, or inability to coherently define this right.” Thus, (Petersen, 1995, p170-171) “making it difficult to determine exactly when the right to privacy
        has been violated.” – pertaining to the definition of privacy. Petersen said that laws that are currently in placed are inadequate, or it simply has not been placed. One attempt to solve privacy was to give the person who owns the information
        a control to opt-out and destroy the information provided should they wish to do so, but Petersen (1995) argues that the method is fundamentally flawed. (Petersen, 1995, p179-180).</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There are many ways of which online entities can circumvent the process of using one’s personal information for other means than what it was originally collected for. Privacy concerns and abuse will not completely be resolved anytime soon as technology
        advances and information becomes more readily available and technically become easier and cheaper to collect and store information for however long while it still serves its purpose to whoever possesses them.</p>

    <p>Although laws protecting individual privacy may have improved since then, the primary concern now and is becoming the bigger problem is the number of security breaches that has happened to several corporations revealing customers’ many sensitive
        information. There were many known instances where criminals managed to breach and retrieve plenty of sensitive information from online services and corporations. A notorious example is a dating site called Ashley Madison which contained information
        such as sexual attributes, preference and other information which most people would not want to disclose publically. This only shows that data protection that are in placed by online corporations themselves are not enough to protect customers’
        information to their customers’ interest. References
