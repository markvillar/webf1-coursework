<h1>Introduction</h1>
<article class="article">
    <p>I am web enthusiast based in London, who's currently studying at the University of Portsmouth. Feel free to look browse on my page. This web page contains some of my work that I have gathered throughout the year at University. I have posted a gallery
        page which contains few photos that I have taken as well as a short clip of an approaching train at Portsmouth Southsea Station.

    <h2>Computer Architecture</h2>
    <h3>Hardware controls & Memory Management</h3>
    <p>Operating systems plays a big part in taking control of hardware peripherals, components such as printers, 3D printers, scanners, speakers, televisions are either directly or indirectly controlled by computers programmatically. Operating systems is
        also the system that is responsible in managing computer memory (Memory Management) between application programs by allocating and deallocating space for whichever program needs it.</p>

    <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
    <p>The operating system also manages user permissions in a computer, this allows system administrators or computer owners to allow access to their machines without worrying too much about unauthorised system changes by giving user accounts with certain
        permissions, and as part of its security features, operating systems are also able to detect if certain programs are hogging up the memory by freezing them when claiming too much memory, this stops the operating system from crashing and also prevents
        attacks such as buffer overflows where a program overwrites addresses including the return address which can be replaced with any memory address, which is a huge security flaw if used with wrong intent.</p>

    <h3>Provide User Interface</h3>
    <p>One big feature of the operating systems is their user interfaces which allows users to easily interact with their computers by providing easy click and drag user interface which most users understand instead of typing it all up to the command line
        or terminal. Some of the well-known and commonly used interfaces are Aqua (Apple’s macOS), Metro (Microsoft’s Windows), GNOME, XFCE, Cinamon, Unity (Linux).</p>

    <h2>Graphics compression: Lossy and lossless</h2>
    <p>Lossy compression is a type of compression where an original sharp and high quality image is saved which means it’s quality had to been reduced to remove excess information i.e. about the image’s colours etc., though very minimal and unnoticeable
        most of the time unless the image is zoomed in close range where the image starts to pixelate, this is where the quality reduction becomes noticeable.</p>

    <p>Lossless does not use any form of compression (at least not on the image) and will try to maintain of every detail of the image as much as possible in the expense of larger file sizes, hence lossless usually end up having larger file sizes (usually
        4-5 time larger) compared to lossy images.</p>
